This ROS package contrains a driver for controlling the RX60 robot through a CS8-M robot controller. The ROS package is made for ROSMAKE build system. The node provides a ROS service for controlling the robot. The ROS node can be started using the command: # roslaunch RX60Controller rx60_controller.launch . Before launching the ROS node the robot needs to be running the VAL3 program called "rsd2013" and the PC and robot has to be on the same network.

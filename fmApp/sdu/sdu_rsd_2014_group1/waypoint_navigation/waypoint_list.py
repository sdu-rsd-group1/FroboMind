"""
Notice that the waypoint list must be in ROS_HOME which by default is ~/.ros

Supported waypoint list format:
	easting, northing, yaw, wptid, mode, tolerance, lin_spd, ang_spd, task, wait
Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nXmZ2Yz4_EzWaQ4GabGi4fah6phSRXDoe_4mvrjz-kA/edit#

2013-06-07 KJ First version
2013-11-14 KJ Changed the waypoint list format to:
			  [easting, northing, yaw, wptid, modestr, tolerance, lin_spd, ang_spd, wait, implement]
              Added support for flexible waypoint csv length
